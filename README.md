# Frontend Task: Multiple Choice Quizzes

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!
Thanks for taking the time to work on a frontend takehome assignment.

This README.md details the prompt for your assignment.
Rest assured, we won't use the code for anything other than as part of your application.

> We recommend copy & pasting these instructions into https://dillinger.io/ to view them as formatted text.

## The Situation

We need an embeddable multiple choice quiz widget to help learners evaluate their skills.

You're an engineer at Squareboat and tasked with building it.
Hooray! ðŸŽ‰

See `./mockups/*.png` for rough descriptions of what it should look like.

> Don't bother getting your page exactly like our mockups -- just match the general layout.

### What You're Given

Your application code should live in the `src/` directory. We've set it up to work with React, though you're welcome to add other libraries if you need.

In the `data/quizzes.js` file, we've exported for you a set of `quizzes`, each of which contains the following data:

- `title`: A human-readable display text title for the quiz

- `questions` An ordered list of questions to be asked, each of which consists of:
  - `text`
  - `correctAnswer`
  - `incorrectAnswers`

### Feature Requirements

Your code will allow the user to take each of those `quizzes` in order.

1. For a current quiz, display its title on top of the page, along with a single questionâ€™s text and randomly ordered answers -- starting with the first question

2. When a questionâ€™s answer is clicked, it should show:

   - A â€˜Nextâ€™ button at the bottom of the component
   - Either _'Correct!'_ or _'Incorrect...'_ above that button, with the correct answer outlined in green, and the incorrect answer (if any) outlined in red with a ~~strikethrough~~ over its text

3. After all questions have been answered correctly, display a friendly summary screen that lists:

   - How many questions were in the quiz
   - How many of those questions were answered correctly
   - A button to move to the next quiz (or the first quiz, if they just took the last)
   - A random encouragement message _(use `getMessage` from `data/messages.js`)_.

### Delighters

In addition to the base requirements, we'll need you to pick and complete _two_ of the following "delighter" fun features.
We do mean _two_: completing additional features will _not_ gain you points!
Please only complete _two_.

- A: Once both of the quizzes have gotten all answers correct, use `getMoreQuizzes` to load in more quizzes that the user can take.
- B: In addition to the "Next" button after taking a quiz, display the number of times the quiz has been taken along with a "Retake" button.
- C: In addition to the summary showing the number of questions correct after taking a quiz, display a list of the quiz's questions with the user's selected answer and whether it was correct beside each question.
- D: [Add tests](https://codesandbox.io/docs/tests).

See `./mockups/delighters/*.png` for rough descriptions of what B and C would look like.

### Submission Requirements

Please give a high-level summary of the technical decisions you made in `DOCS.md`.
It shouldn't be a full essay - just a few sentences explaining your code's architecture and tradeoffs.

Once that's done, hooray!
Send the codesandbox.io link to us and we'll take a look.
